This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This serves as a dynamic blog using markdown-it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can add posts by creating a markdown file in `posts/` with your page title in the name. This will define the link to your post.

Example: `test-blog.md` gives the static link of `post/test-blog/`.
